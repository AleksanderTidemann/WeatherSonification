> ## Sonification Project
> Make music with the weather! This was the objective of our MCT sonification project, presented at UiO Mar 7, 2020. We sonified the weather, based on online webcam-feeds, with spatialized audio. This was a collaborative project by Jarle Foldeson Steinhovden, Aleksander Tidemann, Gaute Timian Dahl Warden√¶r & Tom Ignatius Wee  

## Color extraction

The frame extraction is based on pythons PIL and color-science libraries in particular and reads consecutive frames from your computer screen. The program extracts weather information by collecting color temperature values based on RGB-averages from nine equally large sections on your screen (as seen in the image below), color temperature average from the entire image, grayscale histogram information (if the entire image is darker or brighter on average) and time values from a specific timezone. This data gives you a "good" indication of what the weather is like and what the image/camera feed looks like.
