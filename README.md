> ## Sonification Project
> Make music with the weather! This was the objective of our MCT sonification project, presented at UiO Mar 7, 2020. We sonified the weather, based on online webcam-feeds, with spatialized audio. This was a collaborative project by Jarle Foldeson Steinhovden, Aleksander Tidemann, Gaute Timian Dahl Warden√¶r & Tom Ignatius Wee  

## Color extraction

The code splits your screen into 9 sections and extracts information (color temperature, RGB-values, histogram, Time-zone, coordiantes etc.). This data gave us an interesting indication of what the weather was like and what the image/camera feed looked like. This was then sent to Pure Data via UDP and sonified.
